for methodology & understanding "Haar-cascade Detection in OpenCV" 
do refer below link itcontains steps you need to follow to build this model-

https://docs.opencv.org/3.3.0/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html

here are steps you need to follow to build this model

install opencv look this link for any help -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuxwAPuQDNo


This video shows Demo

Step by step guide to reproduce the results as below.

Requirements :-
1- install python
2- install opencv 
3- make folders "datasets" &  "trainer" in current directory
make sure all the paths mentioned in code & libraries are available.

Let's Run the program
Process-
1- check if camera is working & detecting face with opencv

2- collect samples of face from camera to train.
	Enter Id number(used to store training images)

3- Train the model
	It will train all the training images

4- Test the model
	add the name for the new face ID names related to ids: example ==> Ganesh for: id=1,  & run the code.
Done!!!!! :)
